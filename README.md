# AI-cat-Image-Detector-
The AI Cat Image Detector is a Python program designed to detect whether an image contains a cat or not using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented with TensorFlow and Keras. The program follows a series of steps to load, pre-process, train, and evaluate the model for accurate cat detection.
